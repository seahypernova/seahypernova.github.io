            I have a wide range of hobies and I'm especially an amateur sports and music lover. High jumping is one of my
            favorite sports, on which I've won 3 gold (each during Junior High, Senior High and College) and 1 silver medals
            in the school sports meetings I've participated in. Besides that, I'm also the goal keeper of the PKU EECS
            football team. As for music, I play the piano, the guitar a lot and the violin a bit, having a taste for mainly
            classical music as well as rock and contry music.
